# Decision trees

`Decision trees` is a collection of all the processes I follow when I attempt to decide what I'm supposed to do at some point.

`Decision trees` is my attempt at the introspection and modeling of my own decisions processes in order to improve them.

# How to use

Start by taking a look at `main.decision`. From there, you will be guided to consult its subprograms and their subprograms and so on like a regular program.

# Notes

The current description language is not defined yet but looks a lot like `python`. However, you will soon realize that the language is not all legal `python`. The purpose of this choice is to make it easy for anyone to read the procedure without having it being cluttered with syntactic elements. This allows me to focus on the features and properties that would be required to make the language as concise and relevant as possible.
