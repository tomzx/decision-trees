# Decision trees

`Decision trees` is a collection of all the processes I follow when I attempt to decide what I'm supposed to do at some point.

`Decision trees` is my attempt at the introspection and modeling of my own decisions processes in order to improve them.

# Requirements

python 3.5 <=

# How to use

Start by taking a look at `main.decision`. From there, you will be guided to consult its subprograms and their subprograms and so on like a regular program.
