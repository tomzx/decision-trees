# Decision trees

`Decision trees` is a collection of all the processes I follow when I attempt to decide what I'm supposed to do at some point.

`Decision trees` is my attempt at the introspection and modeling of my own decisions processes in order to improve them.

# How to use

The diagrams use the [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) syntax.

To visualize the decision tree diagrams, I suggest you use [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/). You may also visualize the graphs using the [mermaid live editor](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/live_editor/).
